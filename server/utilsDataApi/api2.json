It meant creating quality standards, working with suppliers who achieve them, and sharing that information with our customers. And it radically changed the way people understood and shopped for food. The result has been the highest quality natural and organic products, an unmatched experience in more than 460+ stores, with a passionate team of over 86,000 team members, 5 percent of our total net profits given back to our communities each year, and millions of customers who put their trust in us every day. And since day one, we've worked hard to build the best environment for all 86,000+ Whole Foods team members. We've been on Fortune's Best Places to Work list every year for 20 years straight. Only 12 companies have achieved this. Ever. When you work at Whole Foods, we take care of you.",

That's how often people around the world likely grab for their smartphone- and all that incredible stuff a phone can do that keeps people reaching for it multiple times a day- Qualcomm invented the stuff that made that stuff possible. Who is Qualcomm, and what do we do? We are engineers, scientists and business strategists. We come from different countries and diverse cultures, speak different languages and offer unique perspectives. Together, we focus on a single goal-to lead the way to a new era of intelligent, connected devices. Qualcomm's technologies powered the smartphone revolution by connecting the phone to the Internet, and now we are changing everything about everything else. We pioneered 3G and 4G, propelling mobile to the forefront of the technology world, and now, we are leading the way to 5G that will connect billions more. Our products revolutionize industries from automotive and IoT to healthcare and data-centers, and are allowing millions of devices to connect with each other in new ways never imagined. We've been called dreamers, inventors, rebels, risk takers, pioneers and geeks. We dream big. We invent bigger. Most importantly, we often do what many think is impossible in the name of innovation.

To deliver on this, we serve with passion, with a spirit of excellence, offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families. Our culture is based on our values rooted in respect: respect for ourselves, respect for others, respect for diversity and respect for the future. We can trace our origin back to 1866, when the first European condensed milk factory was opened in Cham, Switzerland, by the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company. One year later, Henri Nestlé, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world's first prepared infant cereals 'Farine lactée' in Vevey, Switzerland. Today, we employ around 328,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 89.5 billion in 2016. Our portfolio covers almost every food and beverage category -offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.",

We also offer Italian-style espresso beverages, cold blended beverages, delicious food, premium teas and selected compact discs through our retail stores. Working at Starbucks is a lot like working with your friends. When you work here, you're not an \"employee\" - we call ourselves \"partners\" because we believe in shared common goals and mutual success. We're dedicated to serving ethically sourced coffee, caring for the environment and giving back to the communities where we do business. Starbucks is an equal opportunity employer of all qualified individuals, including minorities, women, veterans and individuals with disabilities.",

And that's how our brand was born. Today the Burger King Corporation, its affiliates and its franchisees collectively operate more than 15,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries and U. S. territories, serving over 11 million guests per day and they're still coming back for that flame-grilled flavor. The Burger King® brand is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc. (\"RBI\"), which owns three of the world's iconic quick service restaurant brands - Burger King®, Tim Hortons®, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen®. But we still have room to grow - and that's where you come in. We need strong operations, bold marketing, and the best people around to make these brands great. And if we like what we see, there's no limit to how far you could go here. For more information and exciting career opportunities, please RBI's website at www.rbicareers.com.

    "description": "If change means solving one of the biggest challenges of our time by reinventing the way millions of people power their homes with affordable clean energy, then we say bring it on. At Sunrun, we believe that running everything isn't just smart, it's brilliant. We're doing the single most important thing we can-reinventing how homeowners get energy. It doesn't hurt that we're helping the planet, kick starting the economy and having fun while doing it. In 2007, Sunrun co-Founders Ed Fenster and Lynn Jurich set out to solve an important problem-the future of energy-by making home solar mainstream. Upfront cost was a huge barrier to home solar adoption, so they invented a way to remove it. In this pioneering model known as solar service, Sunrun allows homeowners to pay for the power, not the panels. This means Sunrun owns, maintains and monitors the system while homeowners pay for the electricity it produces at a low, locked-in rate-saving them money over time. Simply put, Sunrun makes solar easy and affordable. With high-quality solar service in 17 U. S. states, we're the nation's largest dedicated residential solar provider. Each business day we put $2 million worth of solar onto people's roofs and facilitate one solar installation every 10 minutes. Our network of over 30 leading solar installers employs more than 3,000 people.",
